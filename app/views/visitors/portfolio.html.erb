          <p class="lead text-muted">Several years ago I moved 1200 miles from my home of over 15 years to move back to Texas for family matters. I was laid off during that time and started a new career.</p>
          <p>It was fun for awhile but 7 years or so later I started to miss coding and as fortune favors me, I was an accident and have been unable to work for the last several months. I started looking back at my prevous life and decided I needed to do something about it. I've learned a new language, some of the basics of the popular frameworks used today, and all the great things javascript has been doing since I left. I decided to get back to writing code again. Some of the names have changed but the game is the same.</p>
          <p>That being said, some of these examples are old and outdated but the fact that these applications, I helped design and run, are still going with the same old code some 6-10 years later hakes me happy.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">The big project I worked on was an EDI Mapping Portal Service using VB 5, then C++ and eventually C#. Clients would use our web-based service to do their X12 mapping translations for the transmission of electronic data between to different legacy systems in a scified protocol. We positioned outrselves into being a SaaS provider and you can still read the old press releases as well as look through the old documentation. The project started off as a VB5 app running on 2 large DEC Alpha servers with NT Server running IIS. We also managed the internal network of offices and all the internal and external support and service calls. We built ourselves an Astrix based PBX phone system and integrated that into our network as well. Occasionally we had local clients and serviced them with other developmental needs. A client needed to migrate from using Novell Netware 5 to NT Server Platform and I did that as well as a lot of work on their shared Microsoft Access database which managed the entire company I think. it was a database built like an desktop application. Thanks Form Wizard. . Besides that we did other fn projects like integrate a UMich Directory server for which I wrote the server side API service and another employee built the client plug in for our windows NT machines so we could have a centralized directory to authenticate to. This is common practice now and every one does it. But back then you authentecated to a domain and it was an entire diffrent beast. We wrote scripts and helpers, wherever needed, so it because our all-in-one authenticator. A year or so later Microsoft announced they too had a directory server. Netscape used it first commercially for their browser product but I came up with the Authentication Server because we had a legacy Unix authentication system and a seperate Windows based one. Built it all from scratch in C and C++ back then, now it's a plugin and you use OMNIAuth or something similar. But back in 1999 or whatever year that was, I think we were the only ones doing it. I left the company for a few years to pursue some classes at the University and start a family</p>

                  <p class="card-text" color="white">When I returned a few years later I worked on a large scale email branding service utilizing a custom built Microsoft Outlook API plug-in to manipulate out-going mail to ensure a consistant look and feel went out with each email. They are still using the same system I worked on from almost 10 years ago. Complete with the same home page including the <a href="http://www.lettermark.com/LetterMark-encryption-feature.htm" />Lettermark Encryption option for MS Outlook</a> We also developed our own custom suite of portable applications and a stand alone encryption product as well. You can see those things and poke around in the support wiki and see more about what I did there. Many people worked to build the lettermark system before I was there but the portable security suite and the encryption addon were mainly developed by myself and one other developer. The entire suite of applications were registered and updated via an Active-X plugin we built our own license applications and used the <a href="https://webupdate.rtsz.com">webupdate system</a> to validate ownership of the device buy generating a device specific license-key to prevent piracy and validate authenticity of the produc. It was pretty fancy for it's day. The order of events were to log-in to the webserver, pick your device from those our activex plug-in detected on your system, transfer the hardware information to our system, validate the license and then provide any updates automatically to the USB device directly on your computer's USB device. At the time 512 MB USB devices were all the rage. We sold quite thousands of them. You can see some of my Letermark work still in the <a href="http://support.rtsz.com/mw/index.php?limit=100&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=dhopkins%40rtsz.com&namespace=&associated=1&year=&month=-1">logs</a> from a long time ago as well as remnants of the documentation for Lettermark, the Cryptolock software and Portable Security Suite</p>
