  {title: "carousel", heading: "\"Who Is James K. Polk?\"", body: "- a new play by Kevin J. Alcock - \r\nAlcock's play humorously presents the former President as he attempts to defend his legacy to a modern audience who barely knows his name. The only U.S. President to have first acted as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Polk may have only served for one term, but in those four years, he waged the Mexican-American War, and added Texas, California and the Oregon Territory to the United States. He also indirectly led us into the U.S. Civil War. \"Who Is James K. Polk?\" explores the many facets of this \"dark horse\" candidate who unexpectedly went on to become one of the most hands-on executives ever to occupy the White House.", style_id: 1, user_id: 1, photo_id: 9},

  {title: "carousel", heading: "Politics in Slavery", body: "Polk's political actions on slavery varied depending on which elected position he held. As a US Congressman representing a slave-holding constituency, he voted for every pro-slavery measure brought before Congress. As Speaker of the US House, however, his main goal was to keep the business of government moving forward. He thought that the increasingly high numbers of pro and anti-slave memorials coming before congress hindered good government and threatened the country's stability. To stifle both sides, Polk invoked the \"gag\" rule\" that prevented and legislation regarding slavery from being brought to the floor for discussion. As Governor of Tennessee when the state was divided over the issue (East Tennessee was strongly anti-slavery), Polk's views once again reflected that split, and his course on slavery was fairly moderate. As President of the United States when the country was struggling with the implications of the \"peculiar institution,\" Polk once again tried to keep slavery from becoming an issue, fearing that it could tear the country apart.", style_id: 1, user_id: 1, photo_id: 9}
